Next.js is server rendered by default, meaning your code will not always run in a browser. This is specially true for pages using `getInitialProps`, which will be rendered in your server first before sending the HTML to the browser

This lesson will focus on understanding the way React works in both environments (server and browser).

To go through this lesson it's recommended to have a previous knowledge of:

- The basic lessons
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [Automatic Prerendering](https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/automatic-prerendering)

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
