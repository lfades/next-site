import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'CSR',
  courseId: 'excel',
  lessonId: 'csr'
};

Next.js server-side renders your pages. When a page has `getInitialProps` this is done in each request, when it doesn't we are able to server-side render it once and reuse that result for each request. During this server-side render certain browser APIs are not available.

This lesson will focus on understanding the way React works in both environments (server and browser).

To go through this lesson it's recommended to have a previous knowledge of:

- The basic lessons
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [Automatic Prerendering](https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/automatic-prerendering)

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
