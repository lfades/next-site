## Server Rendered App

You may have noticed something while playing with the app that there are no loading states between page navigations, once you navigate the data is already there and the page is ready, that's the magic of Server Side Rendering.

But what would happen if the request takes too long? Open `lib/shows.js` and add the following line to the beginning of the `getShows` function:

```js
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(), 1000));
```

We added a delay of 1 second to `getShows`, which is being used inside the pages to fetch the shows, it would mean the render will take much longer. You can also do the same by adding some `throttling` in the Network tab in devtools.

Now that we have simulated a slow connection (or a very long data fetch), what can you notice after navigating between routes?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
