};

## Setup

In this lesson, we need a simple Next.js app to play with. Try downloading the following example app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-demo.git
cd next-learn-demo
cd E4-csr
```

You can run it with:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can access the app by going to http://localhost:3000.

The example app shows a list of batman shows in the home page, and you can navigate to every show by clicking on it.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
