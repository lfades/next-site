## Finally

That's it for this lesson, you should be able to understand the small details of using Next.js in an isomorphic environment.

By knowing the differences between a server side rendering and a prerendered page you should be able to decide what's better for you.

You don't have to pick one method over the other, you may pick SSR for a page, CSR for another, or even do both in another page, then create isomorphic hooks and components that can work in any scenario.

Next.js gives you the tools so you can build the site in your own way.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
