## Slow Navigation

Route navigations were slow after introducing a delay, that's because the page won't be rendered until `getInitialProps` has ended.

The user has to wait a long time because a data fetch has not finished, and can end with the conclusion that the site is slow, this is especially harmful in the case of slow connections

What can we do to fix the above issue? Switch to a client-side fetch!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
